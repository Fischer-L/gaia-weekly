### Last week

* [Form Fill]
  - [Bug 1300989] Implement the label composing logic.
    - Implement the form filling part.
    - Investigate how to handle the "Enter" key event and pass it to FormAutofillContent correctly.
    - File bug 1336370 to discuss AutoCompleteResultView separately.
  - [New][Bug 1336370] Since AutoCompleteResultView provides the inconsistent implementation of getLabelAt and getCommentAt with their literal function name, we should fix it to stop the incorrect propagation.
