### Last week

* [Study]
  - Dialer API - Dialer app study is finished. Start to study CallScreen which contains a lot of knowledge about Telephony APIs.

* [STK]
  - [r?][Bug 1126691] Partner tested the trial patch, and the result is PASS.
  - [WIP][Bug 1100218] Provide a patch to use IAC for icc.data. We still need to refactor icc.application and provide a command queue.
  - [WIP][Bug 1126682] We suspect the icc.selectTimeout (common-settings.json) was wrong.
  - [WIP][Bug 1127730] icc_events.js needs Unit Test. I've provided a WIP patch.
  - [CLOSED][Bug 1119573] Based on comment 21, this is a special requirement for VAL, so I close the bug.
