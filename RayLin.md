- [Video Control]
  - Bug 1271765 - Visual refresh of media controls
    - UI discussion with Peko
  - Bug 681553 - [meta] Make HTML5 \<audio\> controls less of a hack
    - No clear goals for now. Need define what we want controls optimized for audio, and UX should do that defining.
    - De-prioritized. Save this bug to after visual refresh.
  - Bug 1222273 - Convert HTML \<video\>/\<audio\> controls to be (mostly?) HTML instead of XUL
    - WIP
    - All but \<stack\> tag replaced with HTML.
    - Adjust position: removing XUL specific style
