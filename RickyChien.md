####DevTools Box-model Planing

* After Patrick's reply in [Bug 1297108](http://bugzil.la/1297108) and vidyo discussion with Honza on Thursday, we agreed to postpone the
New Box-model and target on other HTML refactoring plan since the first priority would target on all de-XUL work in track 2. New feautres will be postponed and won't be as the first priority for a period of time.
* Next candidate would be DevTools's Network Panel which could be a huge React + Redux refactoring work and we have to hold study group do some analysis and survey at the beginning. Most of these work requires lots of experience with React + Redux framework, so it makes sense to take time to learn them from other DevTools panels refactoring. 

###Other

* PTO on Friday.
